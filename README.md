# Cave Exploration Game

## Overview

The Cave Exploration Game is a simple text-based game written in Java, where players navigate a grid-based cave to collect coins, avoid enemies, and score points. Players move in four directions (up, down, left, or right) while interacting with the environment, which includes walls, coins, and enemies. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible without being caught by enemies.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Exploration**: Navigate through a grid where each cell can be empty, contain a coin, or be occupied by an enemy or rock (wall).
- **Random Generation**: The board features randomly placed rocks, coins, and enemies, ensuring a different gameplay experience each time.
- **Player Movement**: Use simple commands (u, d, l, r) to move the player around the board.
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies move towards the player and can end the game if they catch the player.
- **Score System**: Collect coins to increase your score. Each coin collected adds points to your score.
- **Replayability**: Play as many rounds as you want and try to beat your high score.
